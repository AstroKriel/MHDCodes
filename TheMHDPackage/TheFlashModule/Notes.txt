## TODO:
- compute field curvature
- implement script to restart simulations until they reach saturation
  - relevant for Rm=3000, Pm=1, Mach=5
- make sure Mach=5, Rm=3000, Pm=1 simulations have correct driving
  - Nres=72+ are rerunning
- run Nres>72 Mach=10 simulations with CFL=0.5
  - in progress
- setup Nres=576, 1152 bottleneck simulations: Rm=3000, Pm=1 for Mach=0.3 and 5
