## TODO:
- correlation plot of B^2/8pi vs rho u^2
- compute field curvature: Frenet-Serret basis
- implement script to restart simulations until they reach saturation
  - relevant for Rm=3000, Pm=1, Mach=5 and bottleneck runs
- Mach=0.3, Nres=1152 bottleneck sim
  - finish 10 t_turb of 
  - process bottleneck data
- delete saturated data?
